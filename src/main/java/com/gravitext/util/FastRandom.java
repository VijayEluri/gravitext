/**
 * A limited quality but high performance random number generator

 * safety and is best used exclusively by each test thread. The
 * performance advantage over java.util.Random was found to be 34x for
 * Sun JDK 1.5.0_09 and 30x for Sun JDK 1.6.0_01 on Linux 2xCPU. The
 * generation cost for java.util.Random is potentially significant to
 * some performance test cases.
