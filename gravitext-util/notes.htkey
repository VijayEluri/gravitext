Given a method that takes a (generic) Key:

setKey( Key f )

There is no way to determine what KeySpace the key should be in, and
therefore no way to automaticly convert a String to the appropriate key.

Would be nice if there as was typed support of keys:

BaseKey
{
  BaseKey A
  BaseKey B
}


DerivedKey
{
 BaseKey C
 BaseKey D
}

HTMap<BaseKey>

Conclusion: Not terribly worable. Doesn't look good. See
com.gravtext.htmap.DerivedKeyTest case.
