/**
 * A runnable for a concurrent test. Instances are created via a
 * {@link TestFactory} and run by a single test thread. Thus
 * {@link #runIteration } may access class variables without synchronizing. A
 * common case is use of a FastRandom instance, initialized from the seed passed
 * to the TestFactory. The following test is prototypical:
 *
 * <code><pre>
 * new TestRunnable() {
 *     final FastRandom _random = new FastRandom( seed );
 *     public int runIteration( int run )
 *     {
 *         int c = _random.nextInt( 10000 ) + 10;
 *         List&lt;Integer> numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer>( c );
 *         for( int i = 0; i < c; ++i ) {
 *             numbers.add( _random.nextInt( 10000 ) );
 *         }
 *         Collections.sort( numbers );
 *         return numbers.get( 0 ); // return lowest
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre></code>
