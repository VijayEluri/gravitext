/**
 * A factory and container of unique {@link Key} instances. The
 * following code sample shows the common usage pattern:
 *
 * <code><pre>
 * public class MyKeys
 * {
 *     public static final KeySpace KEY_SPACE = new KeySpace();
 *
 *     public static final Key&lt;Double> DBLKEY =
 *         KEY_SPACE.create( "DBLKEY", Double.class );
 *
 *     public static final Key&lt;String> STRKEY =
 *         KEY_SPACE.create( "STRKEY", String.class );
 *
 *     public static final Key<List<String>> SLISTKEY =
 *         KEY_SPACE.createListKey( "SLISTKEY" )
 *
 * }
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * <p>KeySpace instances are internally synchronized to support
 * concurrent access interleaved with new key creation.  Copy-on-write
 * semantics are used, such that read operations are unsynchronized
 * while key creation is synchronized and relatively costly. This
 * trade-off is desirable given the usage pattern of key creation
 * commencing on system startup but generally completing shortly
 * thereafter, while read operations continue with high frequency.</p>
